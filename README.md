## Summary

An application for both iOS and Android featuring The Movie Database as main source of content. Users will be able to search movies, tv series, actors, and more. Optional login is available so that users can rate their favorite shows or dislike the ones they least favorite. Recommendations and discovery features will be included as well. And .. probably more! It's currently in an enfantile stage, but I'm working on it everyday!
